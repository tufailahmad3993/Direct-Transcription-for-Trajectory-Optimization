# Direct-Transcription-for-Trajectory-Optimization
A direct Transcription is a prominent approach in trajectory optimization, a field that focuses on finding optimal paths 
or trajectories for systems that evolve over time, such as robotics, Spacecraft Trajectory Design, and chemical processes. In this problem, we implement trajectory optimization to swing up the cart inverted pendulum.
