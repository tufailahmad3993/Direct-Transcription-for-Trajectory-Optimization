# Direct-Transcription-for-Trajectory-Optimization
Direct Transcription is a prominent approach in trajectory optimization, a field that focuses on finding optimal paths 
or trajectories for systems that evolve over time, such as robotics, aerospace vehicles, and chemical processes. In this problem, we implement the trajectory optimization to swing up the cart inverted pendulum.
